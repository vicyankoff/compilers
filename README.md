This is a semester long project in my Compilers course where
we built a compiler from scratch using pre-defined grammar

It was by far the largest project I've worked on but the
finished program was very rewarding.

The compiler was written for the TruPL (Truman Programming Language)
Front End: Parsing, Lexical Analysis and Semantic Analysis
Back End: Code Generation targeting Tral
